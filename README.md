My favorite Java Google AppEngine Stack for REST-based server backends.

+ Objectify - for data access
+ Jersey - for REST API, including file-upload
+ Guice - DI which holds it all together
+ gson - for JSON serialization
+ hibernate-validator - to veto any ugly data from client

Contains support for local "cross domain" developement (CORS headers).

For now - it still needs some cleaning.
